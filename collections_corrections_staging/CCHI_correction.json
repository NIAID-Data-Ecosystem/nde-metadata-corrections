            "description": "The long-term goal of the Cooperative Centers on Human Immunology (CCHI) program is to translate immunology research into clinical applications in humans in the areas of infectious disease and immune-mediated diseases. CCHI supports mechanistic and hypothesis-testing studies to discover novel molecules, mechanisms, or regulatory pathways governing function of the human immune system in both healthy and vulnerable populations (i.e., across lifespan, organ/tissue transplant recipients, and pregnant women).
