The research thus focuses on defining the immunologic states and dynamics that drive the development of autoimmune diseases with the goal of preventing autoimmunity or stalling its clinical progression. All IDAD projects are focused solely on human subjects. For more information, visit the NIAID program page: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/immune-drivers-autoimmune-disease-idad",
