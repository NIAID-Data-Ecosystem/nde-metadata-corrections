The centers are designed to conduct research on the cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of NTDs, and to build in-country research capacity. The program has increased capacity of local TMRC awardees to support independent research activities, conduct future clinical trials, and implement new treatment, prevention, and vector control strategies.
