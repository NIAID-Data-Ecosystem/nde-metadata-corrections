            "description": "The Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Interdisciplinary Research Units (CARBIRUs) are multidisciplinary research centers focused on bacterial pathogens for which antibiotic resistance poses a significant public health concern, as designated by the CDC\u2019s 2019 Report on Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States. Each center brings together investigators from multiple disciplines to investigate non-antibiotic alternative treatment and preventive strategies, including bacteriophage, monoclonal antibodies, ligand mimetics, and defined microbial consortia; poorly understood resistance mechanisms contributing to bacterial persistence and antibiotic treatment failure; and identification and validation of novel bacterial targets for antibiotic intervention.
